## Hey 👋, we're Voltrix
Before anyone asks, yes, we're a bunch of geeks, but we prefer the term "passionate in our respective fields". Nevertheless, our team is full of passionate designers developers, and testers, but more importantly **people**. We collectivly share an idea that the term "good enough" isn't good enough, and can always be further improved and refined. We all share a goal of imagining something slightly **different**, **unique**, **new**, and **fresh** *(we know, roll credits)*. Essentially we create new and existing things, then constantly make improvements *(and fix bugs, lots of them)* 😩.

### 🍿 So what does this "imagine something fresh" mean?
* (adj) making something unique, polished, and to actually update it more than twice a year.
* Glad you asked, basically it means that we can't stop messing around with our stuff. It means that we prioritize quality over quantity, that everything has love 💗 in it *(and tears, those too)*.
* It means that you're not just getting the same thing over and over again, but rather that things are changing 🚀.
* It reconizes that a product can't be perfect, and things can always be tweaked 🔧, 

### 👓 Nice, so what's going on right now
* TBD
